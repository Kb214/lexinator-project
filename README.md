# lexinator-project
This website is to update my Lexinator project I did in my freshmen year of college.  
## The Website:  
This is a Lexus car fan website that hosts the good and and bad cars in the history of lexus that I picked myself. I will probably add more pages and more flashiness to it overtime. To the people who see this, I hope you like what you see!

                <h2>The Lexus</h2>
                <p><strong>Lexus (レクサス, Rekusasu)</strong> is the luxury vehicle division of the Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corporation. 
                    The Lexus brand is marketed in more than 90 countries and territories worldwide and is Japan's largest-selling make of premium cars. 
                    It has ranked among the 10 largest Japanese global brands in market value.Lexus is headquartered in Nagoya, Japan.
                     Operational centers are located in Brussels, Belgium, and Plano, Texas, United States.</p>

                <h3>Why should you get one?</h3>
                <p>You should get a Lexus because its parent company is Toyota and they are known for how reliable their cars are.
                   The Lexus on its own though is a very great car and is built on <em>high quality</em> materials and it shows through their
                    car prices. They build their cars with carbon fiber, steel frames, durable steel components for handling and comfort, 
                    and they have their own special trim made out of wood called the <strong>Shimamoku trim</strong>. It takes 38 days to make and goes
                    through 67 manufacturing phases. They are very fuel efficient and have very great safety features. Lexus values perfection
                    and is overseen by <em>10 groups of professional craftsmen</em> that pass on their knowledge to technicians. Each year and everyday
                    they are working to innovate their cars to be the best for their customers.

                <h4>Most Underrated Lexus Car of 2024</h4>

                  <div class="post-content">
                    <p>The Lexus LC 500 is a luxury sedan that offers both coupe and convertible build options with 2x2 seating
                      and a naturally aspirated 471-hp 5.0 liter V-8 standard engine. The V-6 engine is also offered at your request.
                      It has absolutely amazing handling and steering abilities with minimal body roll, variable-steering, and 
                      adaptive rear wheel steering systems. The LC500 is very heavy with the hybrid being heavier. Despite this,
                      the hybrid’s eclectic components are more favorable with the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) standards.
                      When it comes to fuel economy the hybrid also succeeds with a total of 29 mpg compared to the 18 mpg with 
                      the LC500. You’ll save <strong>$6,000 of annual fuel cost</strong> as it only costs $3.51 for 25 miles. You’ll also get a 
                      bigger tank size of 22.2 gallons. 
          
                    </p>

                    <p>The pricing of this car goes from $99,800 to $107,000 depending on the build you’re getting. You may also get charged 
                      extra for upgrades ranging from 1,900 to $6,400.</p>

                      The up and coming new gen all-electric sedan, part four door coupe and part hatchback is especially 
                      beautiful being a part of the 4th generation IS model. At the 2023 Japan Mobility Show we got to see
                      this beautiful sedan. It is a stark change from the past sedans, having a very angular but sleek 
                      look to it. With this sedan they will be employing a new AWD called the “Direct 4” system, a steer
                      -by-wire technology, and the “Arene OS" that allows over-the-air software updates. It is 187 inches
                      long, 74 inches wide, and 54.7 inches tall. Comparing it to the midsize ES, it’s quite small.
